# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React.

## How to Play

- Two players take turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all spaces on the grid are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
